## SR Tracker

`SR` is a ranking number that the game `Overwatch` uses. However, this web application could be used to track wins, losses, and ties for anything really.

It uses Firebase and will eventually be integrated with Twitch extensions in some way.

Currently this is just a form where the data is saved to a Firestore and uses React Router. It's main purpose right now is to be used as an overlay in streaming applications, (and later on I want to add more interactivity via Twitch extensions).

Right now this repo is for personal use but as this project evolves I'll be hosting this code somewhere and refactoring it quite a bit.

I think it works well because the Firebase instance is exportable.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## How it works

Set up a Firebase Firestore account and get that running. Create a .env file in the root of the project with the following lines set to the credentials given to you when siging up.

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY=
REACT_APP_AUTH_DOMAIN=
REACT_APP_DATABASE_URL=
REACT_APP_PROJECT_ID=
REACT_APP_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=
```

Add this line as well, make the name a random string.

```REACT_APP_OW_ID=sdasdadd```

Run the project with `npm start` and open your browser to `localhost:3000/tracker` and another window at `localhost:3000/display`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
